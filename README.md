# WCL

Have you ever used `wc -l`? I have. If you are running said command on a processor modern enough that `wc` can't reasonably support some hardware features of your CPU, you might use `wcl` instead - it's around three times faster benched on 200,000 files of 1-5000 lines each.

Is this useful? Maybe. Is it "blazingly fast"? Probably not yet.
